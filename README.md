# Furry Game
My first JavaScript game created at Coders Lab workshop.

## About a concept

A goal of this task was to use object-oriented programming.

## How it works

The hero of a game is **Furry**, which moves on the 10x10 board. Player controls Furry with arrow keys to collect as many coins as possible. After every success the coin appears in different place of the board.
The game ends when player hit the wall.

## Used technologies/tools
